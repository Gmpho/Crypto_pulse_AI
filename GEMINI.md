# Gemini Project Context & Operational Playbook

This file contains context for the Gemini AI assistant to help it understand the project, its goals, and how to best assist in its development.

## Project: CryptoPulse AI

*   **Security-First**: Emphasizes threat modeling, secure key management, and continuous monitoring.
*   **Production-Ready**: Designed as a robust microservices architecture with full CI/CD and observability.

### Tech Stack

## Gemini's Role & Operational Principles

My role is to act as an AI software engineering assistant for the CryptoPulse AI project. I will adhere to the following principles:

*   **Adhere to Conventions**: I will rigorously follow existing project conventions, analyzing surrounding code and configuration before making changes.
*   **Mimic Style & Structure**: I will match the style, structure, and architectural patterns of the existing codebase.
*   **Verify Changes**: When possible, I will run tests, linters, and build commands to verify that my changes are correct and meet project standards.
*   **Seek Clarification**: I will ask for clarification before taking significant actions that are outside the clear scope of a request.

## User Preferences

*(You can add your preferences here. For example:)*
*   *Please always run the linter after making code changes.*
*   *I prefer smaller, more frequent commits.*
