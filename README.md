## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   An npm-compatible package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Gmpho/Crypto-pulse-Ai.git
    cd Crypto-pulse-Ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key to power the AI chat features. Without it, the chat will run in a mock mode with pre-programmed responses.

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Gemini API key to this file. **Note:** Since this is a client-side application, the environment variable needs to be prefixed (e.g., `VITE_` for Vite projects) to be exposed to the browser. Let's assume a Vite setup:
        ```.env
        VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
    *   You can get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    *If you are using Vite:*
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).
