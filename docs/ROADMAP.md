# Implementation Guide & Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan, development roadmap, and pre-launch checklist for CryptoPulse AI.

## 1. Design & Prototyping

*   [ ] **Code Tool Functions**: Implement and test core tool functions (`get_price`, `place_order`, etc.) in isolation.
*   [ ] **Simple LangChain Agent**: Build a simple agent to verify the function-calling loop with the implemented tools.

## 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

*   [ ] **Scaffold Project**: Create a new FastAPI project.
*   [ ] **Endpoints**: Create endpoints for authentication, chat (`/api/chat`), market data (`/api/prices`), and orders.
*   [ ] **Supabase Integration**: Wire in the Supabase SDK for user management and data access.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management**: Configure environment variables for secrets (Gemini key, Binance keys, Supabase URL/keys).

## 3. Frontend Development (React)

*   [ ] **Project Setup**: Use Vite or Create React App to set up the React/TypeScript project.
*   [ ] **Build Core Components**: Develop `Chart`, `ChatPanel`, `NewsFeed`, `AlertModal`, `WalletModal`, etc.
*   [ ] **State Management**: Implement state stores or React Context for chat sessions and portfolio data.
*   [ ] **API Connection**: Connect frontend components to the backend APIs.

## 4. Data Integration

*   [ ] **Data Service Layer**: Implement a Python service to fetch data from CoinGecko (for prices) and CryptoCompare (for news).
*   [ ] **Resiliency**: Add circuit-breaker logic and caching to handle API failures gracefully.
*   [ ] **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all data-fetching functions.

## 5. Trading Logic

*   [ ] **Initial Strategy**: Start with a simple, well-understood trading strategy (e.g., RSI-based).
*   [ ] **Risk Checks**: Wrap LLM-generated trade signals with internal risk checks (e.g., max trade size, stop-loss).
*   [ ] **Confirmation**: Initially, require user confirmation for all trades.
*   [ ] **Testnet**: Use the Binance testnet to simulate all trading logic.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

*   [ ] **Lint & Type-Check**: Set up ESLint for TypeScript and mypy/flake8 for Python.
*   [ ] **Unit Tests**: Configure Jest for the frontend and pytest for the backend.
*   [ ] **Security Scans**: Run Snyk or OWASP ZAP to scan for known vulnerabilities.
*   [ ] **Docker Build**: Create Docker images for the `frontend` and `backend` and tag them with the commit SHA.
*   [ ] **Deployment**: Deploy to a `staging` environment on pull requests and to `production` on merge to `main` (using Fly.io).

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

*   [ ] **Sentry Integration**: Register and initialize the Sentry SDK in both the React and FastAPI applications.
*   [ ] **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Set up alerts and logging on Fly.io or a third-party service (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana).

## 8. Testing

*   [ ] **Integration Tests**: Write tests for the interaction between services. Mock Binance responses or use testnet endpoints.
*   [ ] **E2E Tests**: Simulate a full user flow, from a chat request to a verified tool call on the backend.
*   [ ] **Code Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage on critical modules.

## 9. Documentation

*   [ ] **Developer Docs**: Maintain architecture diagrams, data flow descriptions, and API contracts (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
*   [ ] **User Stories**: Outline user stories for investor demos.

## 10. Security Review

*   [ ] **Threat Model Walkthrough**: Conduct a final review of the threat model before launch.
*   [ ] **Secret Scan**: Verify that no secrets have been committed to the source repository.
*   [ ] **Dependency Check**: Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and have been scanned for vulnerabilities.
*   [ ] **Penetration Test**: Perform a penetration test on authentication endpoints.

## Checklist Before Launch

- [ ] **Code & PRs**: All features merged and tested. Linting/type-check passing.
- [ ] **Secrets**: No keys in repo. Production keys stored in vault or environment only.
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Pipelines green; deployment process verified.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Backend and frontend running on staging (Fly.io).
- [ ] **Security**: Sentry and security scans active. RLS policies in Supabase tested.
- [ ] **Risk Controls**: Max trade sizes, stop-loss rules configured. Emergency “panic button” endpoint implemented.
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Sentry dashboards set; log aggregation checked. Alerts configured.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Whitepaper, API reference, and architecture diagrams are complete.
- [ ] **Demo**: Investor demo is prepared and rehearsed.
