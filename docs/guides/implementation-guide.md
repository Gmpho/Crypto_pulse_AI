# Implementation Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step plan for implementing the CryptoPulse AI project, from initial setup to production deployment.

## Week 1: Foundation Setup

*   [ ] **Apply SQL migration to Supabase**
*   [ ] **Set up local development environment with Docker**
*   [ ] **Configure environment variables**
*   [ ] **Implement basic FastAPI backend structure**
*   [ ] **Set up frontend with Vite + React + TypeScript**

## Week 2: Core Integration

*   [ ] **Implement Coinbase Wallet SDK integration**
*   [ ] **Add SIWE authentication flow**
*   [ ] **Set up LangChain AgentExecutor**
*   [ ] **Implement basic trading tools**
*   [ ] **Configure KMS for secret management**

## Week 3: Advanced Features

*   [ ] **Implement MCP server for Supabase**
*   [ ] **Add Playwright MCP for UI automation**
*   [ ] **Set up audit logging system**
*   [ ] **Implement risk management controls**
*   [ ] **Configure CI/CD pipeline**

## Week 4: Production Readiness

*   [ ] **Set up monitoring with Sentry + Prometheus**
*   [ ] **Implement comprehensive testing**
*   [ ] **Configure production deployment**
*   [ ] **Perform security audit**
*   [ ] **Create documentation and runbooks**

## Implementation Checklist

### Prototype LLM Pipeline

*   [ ] Start with a simple LangChain agent that can use dummy tools.
*   [ ] Test with a controlled prompt (e.g. ask for a static price) to ensure the loop works.

### Integrate Market Data

*   [ ] Wire in CCXT or direct API for real-time prices.
*   [ ] Test queries like “What’s BTC price?” through the agent.

### Charting Tool

*   [ ] Add a chart-generation function.
*   [ ] Have the LLM call `generate_chart("BTC", "1d", [MA10, MA50])` and verify an image is returned.

### Trading Tool (Testnet)

*   [ ] Connect a sandbox trading account (e.g. Binance Testnet).
*   [ ] Implement `place_order` and log executions.
*   [ ] Try prompts like “Buy 0.01 BTC”.
*   [ ] Ensure the agent only acts on explicit commands and logs details for each order.

### User Interface

*   [ ] Build a React chat interface.
*   [ ] Integrate WebSockets or REST to send user messages and display AI responses (with images).
*   [ ] Test end-to-end: user asks a question, backend returns text + image, UI displays both.

### Voice I/O (Optional)

*   [ ] Add microphone input and playback using Web Speech API or OpenAI’s Whisper API.

### Security & Testing

*   [ ] Perform unit tests on each tool.
*   [ ] Conduct penetration tests and ensure no credentials are exposed.
*   [ ] Use the exchange’s sandbox thoroughly before live deployment.

### CI/CD Setup

*   [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to run linters/tests, then build Docker images and deploy to Fly.io on commits.
*   [ ] Use separate branches/environments for staging vs production.

### Monitoring and Backtesting

*   [ ] Implement Sentry alerts for errors.
*   [ ] (Future) Gather trading logs to backtest performance of the AI strategies versus benchmarks.

### Regulatory Compliance

*   [ ] Ensure proper disclaimers (e.g. KYC/AML if needed).
*   [ ] If expanding to new regions, adapt to local regulations (e.g. SEC rules in the U.S., MiCA in Europe).
