# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its integration into the CryptoPulse AI project.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that enables Large Language Model (LLM)-based clients to securely call servers that expose data, actions, and tools. It acts as a secure and audited bridge, giving LLMs safe access to our database, UI automation, and third-party APIs.

### Key Benefits

*   **Standardized Integration:** MCP provides a standard way for LLM agents to communicate with various services, avoiding the need for custom-built integrations.
*   **Enhanced Security:** MCP is designed with security in mind, providing features like authentication, authorization, and audit logging.
*   **Discoverability:** MCP servers can be registered with a service like Smithery.ai, making them discoverable to other services and clients.

## MCP Architecture

Our MCP architecture consists of three main components:

*   **MCP Servers:** These servers expose specific functionalities to the LLM agent. We have several MCP servers, including:
    *   **Supabase MCP Server:** For database queries, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and audit logging.
    *   **Playwright MCP Server:** For UI automation, such as running tests and taking screenshots.
    *   **Stripe MCP Server:** For handling payment operations.
    *   **Exchange MCP Server:** A normalized wrapper around exchange APIs for programmatic trading.
*   **MCP Clients:** Our LangChain agent uses MCP clients to communicate with the MCP servers.
*   **Smithery.ai:** We use Smithery.ai as a registry for discovering and managing our MCP servers.

## Security and Governance

Security is a top priority in our MCP implementation. We enforce the following security measures:

*   **Authentication:** All MCP calls are authenticated using short-lived JWTs or mTLS.
*   **Authorization:** We use a scope-based access control system to ensure that MCP clients only have access to the resources they need.
*   **Secrets Management:** We use a Key Management System (KMS) to manage all our secrets. MCP servers only have access to the secrets they need, and secrets are never exposed to the LLM agent.
*   **Audit Logging:** All MCP calls are logged to an immutable audit log, providing a clear record of all actions performed by the LLM agent.

## Implementation

We have a detailed implementation plan for our MCP integration, which includes skeleton code for our MCP servers in both Node/TypeScript and Python/FastAPI. For more details, please refer to the following guides:
