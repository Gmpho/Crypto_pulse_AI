# ADR-003: Security and Key Management Strategy

**Date:** 2025-09-20

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The CryptoPulse AI platform handles sensitive user data, including API keys for cryptocurrency exchanges. A robust security and key management strategy is essential to protect this data and to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a comprehensive security and key management strategy based on the principle of zero-trust and least-privilege. The key components of this strategy are:

*   **Key Management System (KMS):** All sensitive keys (exchange API secrets, database passwords, etc.) will be stored in a dedicated secrets manager, such as AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault. Keys will be encrypted at rest and only decrypted in memory for immediate use.
*   **Environment Separation:** We will maintain distinct keys and credentials for development, staging, and production environments. This will prevent development and testing activities from affecting the production environment.
*   **Least Privilege:** Exchange API keys will be granted minimal permissions. For example, we will issue separate keys for read-only operations (e.g., fetching prices) and write operations (e.g., placing trades). Database roles will also follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **Key Rotation and Audit:** We will enforce periodic rotation of secrets and maintain a full audit trail of all actions involving keys.
*   **Secure Tool Calls:** The LLM agent will not have direct access to keys. All tool calls that require access to sensitive data will be performed by the backend, which will use the KMS to decrypt the keys in memory for the duration of the operation.
*   **Data Protection:** All network traffic will be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS. We will use JWTs with short expiry for user sessions, and all personal information will be encrypted at rest in the database.

## Rationale

This strategy is based on industry best practices for securing sensitive data in cloud-native applications. It provides a multi-layered approach to security that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to user data and funds.

## Consequences

*   **Positive:**
    *   Significantly improves the security of the platform.
    *   Reduces the risk of financial loss for users.
    *   Increases user trust in the platform.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Adds complexity to the development and deployment process.
    *   Requires careful management of the KMS and the associated keys.
