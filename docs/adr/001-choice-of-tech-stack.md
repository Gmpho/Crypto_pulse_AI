# ADR 001: Choice of Core Technology Stack

*   **Status**: Accepted
*   **Date**: 2025-09-19

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a core technology stack for CryptoPulse AI that allows for rapid development, is scalable, secure, and leverages the strengths of the AI and web development ecosystems. The project requires a responsive web frontend, a robust backend to handle business logic and AI processing, and a flexible data store.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Development**: The stack should enable us to build and iterate quickly.
*   **AI/ML Ecosystem**: We need seamless access to modern AI/ML libraries and frameworks, particularly for LLM integration.
*   **Scalability**: The architecture must be able to scale to handle a growing number of users and complex background tasks.
*   **Security**: The stack must support modern security best practices, especially for handling sensitive user data and API keys.
*   **Developer Experience**: The chosen technologies should have strong community support, good documentation, and be enjoyable to work with.

## Considered Options

1.  **Python/FastAPI Backend + React/TypeScript Frontend**: A hybrid stack with Python for the backend and a modern JavaScript framework for the frontend.
2.  **Full-Stack JavaScript/TypeScript**: Using Node.js (e.g., with Express or NestJS) for the backend and React/TypeScript for the frontend.
3.  **Monolithic Python Framework**: Using a full-stack Python framework like Django or Flask with server-side templates.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Python/FastAPI Backend + React/TypeScript Frontend.

### Rationale

*   **Best of Both Worlds**: This approach allows us to leverage the rich AI/ML ecosystem of Python (with libraries like LangChain, PyTorch, etc.) for the backend, while using the mature and powerful React ecosystem for building a modern, responsive user interface.
*   **Performance**: FastAPI is a high-performance Python framework that is well-suited for building APIs. Its asynchronous nature makes it a good choice for handling I/O-bound tasks like interacting with external APIs.
*   **Developer Experience**: Both FastAPI and React have excellent documentation and strong community support. The separation of concerns between the frontend and backend leads to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
*   **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript on the frontend and Python with type hints on the backend provides a good level of type safety, which helps to reduce bugs and improve code quality.

## Consequences

*   **Increased Complexity**: Managing a polyglot codebase and the interface between two separate applications (frontend and backend) adds some complexity compared to a monolithic approach.
*   **DevOps Overhead**: We will need to manage the build and deployment process for two separate applications.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Python/FastAPI + React/TypeScript

*   ✅ **Pros**: Access to Python's AI ecosystem, high-performance backend, excellent developer experience, strong type safety.
*   ❌ **Cons**: Increased complexity, DevOps overhead.

### Option 2: Full-Stack JavaScript/TypeScript

*   ✅ **Pros**: Single language for the entire stack, potentially easier to manage.
*   ❌ **Cons**: The AI/ML ecosystem in JavaScript is not as mature as in Python.

### Option 3: Monolithic Python Framework

*   ✅ **Pros**: Simpler to develop and deploy initially.
*   ❌ **Cons**: Tightly coupled architecture, can be harder to scale and maintain. Modern frontend development can be more challenging with this approach.
